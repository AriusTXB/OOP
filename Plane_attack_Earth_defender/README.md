-Hello, Welcome to my first Game-project💻!
-In this game, you will be a pilot whom mission is to stop 100 UFOS 👽 from  invading the Earth🌏.
-As the pilot, you have a special fighter ✈️ to put up a fight, learn how to use it properly:
    + W 🔼 : Going straight forward with a Hydrogen-fueled rockets🔥.
    + S 🔽 : Going back the oposite direction.
    + A ◀️ : Pointing your fighter and lazer canon's angle to the left. 
    + D ▶️ : Pointing your fighter and lazer canon's angle to the right. 
    + L ☄️ : Firing many lazer beams with high speed.
    + K 💥 : Firing bigger size lazer canon balls with lower speed, you should choose wisely between 2 of them for highest efficiency.
-The game is pretty much inspired by DJ_Raven, check him out on Youtube.
-Please give me more ideas 💡 to update the games 🕹!
